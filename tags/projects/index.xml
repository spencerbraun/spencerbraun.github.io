      <title>Demand Forecasting with Bayesian Methods</title>

      <description>The Stanford Medical system sees a constant stream of patients through its doors every year, many of whom require intensive care. Blood transfusions are a common occurrence as part of a therapy or surgery, but blood platelets are a scarce resource that have a short shelf life. Therefore accurately predicting future demand is essential in order to minimize waste while ensuring hospitals have enough on hand for the current patient population.</description>

      <title>Chinese Word Segmentation: Classic and Modern Methods</title>

      <description>Part of the fun of NLP is the diversity of language structures that models must consider. Tools that are built in a monolingual context can easily fail to achieve more global utility. If you just work in English, you may find word embeddings fun and useful, but the German Komposita don’t fit neatly into our English-centric boxes. Similarly, once we leave the Latin alphabet, we acquire all sorts of new challenges.</description>

      <title>Selectively Editable Language Models</title>

      <description>The post belows explains a project in editing language models I completed as part of Stanford’s course in natural language processing. If you want to skip to the point, the report and code are freely available.
Background: Taming Large Language Models Large language models have been an area of exciting development in the last few years, and we now have applications and entire companies built around their improving performance and utility.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Text Style Transfer with Deep Learning</title>

      <description>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one area of deep learning that continues to make substantial, and often surprising, progress while also adding value to existing businesses. Supervised tasks like neural machine translation produce high quality, real-time results and Gmail&amp;rsquo;s predictive text feature often feels like magic. I have been most interested in recent applications of generative text models, such as using GPT-2 to play chess, write poetry, or create custom games.</description>

      <title>Yield Curves in Dash</title>

      <description>With a lot of recent focus on the direction of US interest rates and the likelihood of a recession, I thought I would play around with Treasury yield data to construct an easy way to keep an eye on how yield curves are changing. For those unfamiliar, yield curves are simple plots of the yield of a Treasury bill, note, or bond versus the maturities of the securities. The Treasury publishes the market yield for each maturity daily.</description>

      <title>Creating a Personal Site From Scratch</title>

      <description>I had a bit of time on my hands this summer and decided it would be a good time to build a personal website. I thought it would be a good place to display some work and encourage myself to write more. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how big a project this would be but tried out a bunch of options and ended up quite happy with Github Pages and a Flask static site generator.</description>
