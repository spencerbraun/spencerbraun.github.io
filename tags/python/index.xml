      <description>The Stanford Medical system sees a constant stream of patients through its doors every year, many of whom require intensive care. Blood transfusions are a common occurrence as part of a therapy or surgery, but blood platelets are a scarce resource that have a short shelf life. Therefore accurately predicting future demand is essential in order to minimize waste while ensuring hospitals have enough on hand for the current patient population.</description>

      <description>The post belows explains a project in editing language models I completed as part of Stanfordâ€™s course in natural language processing. If you want to skip to the point, the report and code are freely available.
Background: Taming Large Language Models Large language models have been an area of exciting development in the last few years, and we now have applications and entire companies built around their improving performance and utility.</description>

      <description>With a lot of recent focus on the direction of US interest rates and the likelihood of a recession, I thought I would play around with Treasury yield data to construct an easy way to keep an eye on how yield curves are changing. For those unfamiliar, yield curves are simple plots of the yield of a Treasury bill, note, or bond versus the maturities of the securities. The Treasury publishes the market yield for each maturity daily.</description>

      <description>I had a bit of time on my hands this summer and decided it would be a good time to build a personal website. I thought it would be a good place to display some work and encourage myself to write more. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how big a project this would be but tried out a bunch of options and ended up quite happy with Github Pages and a Flask static site generator.</description>
