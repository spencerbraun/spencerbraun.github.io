      <title>NAACL 2022: Does Summary Evaluation Survive Translation?</title>

      <description>Paper
Code
I recently presented a paper at the NAACL 2022 conference for work conducted with my colleagues at Primer in collaboration with Technische Universit√§t Berlin. At Primer, summarization is a core task that our platform performs daily, but summarization evaluation is quite challenging even in English. Since we are often presented with data from many languages, we explored whether summarization datasets could remain useful under translation, as resources for non-English languages are far less plentiful.</description>

      <title>Demand Forecasting with Bayesian Methods</title>

      <description>The Stanford Medical system sees a constant stream of patients through its doors every year, many of whom require intensive care. Blood transfusions are a common occurrence as part of a therapy or surgery, but blood platelets are a scarce resource that have a short shelf life. Therefore accurately predicting future demand is essential in order to minimize waste while ensuring hospitals have enough on hand for the current patient population.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Text Style Transfer with Deep Learning</title>

      <description>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one area of deep learning that continues to make substantial, and often surprising, progress while also adding value to existing businesses. Supervised tasks like neural machine translation produce high quality, real-time results and Gmail&amp;rsquo;s predictive text feature often feels like magic. I have been most interested in recent applications of generative text models, such as using GPT-2 to play chess, write poetry, or create custom games.</description>
