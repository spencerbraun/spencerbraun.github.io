      <description>Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy by William Janeway
Bill Janeway has a lot to say in this book, and he does so with dense and clear prose. In three points, this book makes clear:
 The innovation economy is a three player game among the state, the market economy, and financial institutions. The game is played with irreducible uncertainty, and playing by the rules of homo-economicus (some neoclassical rational agent) is not a successful strategy.</description>
