  I'm a research scientist focused on natural language processing and multimodal applications of transformers. I currently work at <a href="https://www.primer.ai">Primer</a>, a startup focused on bringing NLP-enhanced tools to intelligence and defense applications. My research interests are broad, but lately I am especially excited by information embedding and retrieval, relation extraction and growing knowledge bases, and data efficient methods.
  <br><br>
  My prior experiences are diverse, and I'm lucky to have collaborated with many talented economists, statisticians, computer scientists, and physicists. I pursued a Master's in Statistics at Stanford from 2019-2021, where I got involved with research in the Stanford AI Lab creating editable language models and with economists measuring the causal impact of automation on wages. I worked at <a href="https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/">Hudson River Trading</a>, an algorithmic trading firm, for three years, automating trade settlement and cash management and analyzing factors contributing to returns. Out of college, I worked in economic consulting at <a href="https://www.thinkbrg.com/">Berkeley Research Group</a>, building damages models under economists and industry experts that were used to resolve contractual disputes.
